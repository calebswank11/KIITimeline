The tuition was a whopping $300 a year and it was worth every penny. His senior thesis was the first public look at Fred&rsquo;s ingenuity and resourcefulness. In it, he laid out his environmental idea to take a waste product from a pulp mill and reuse it as fuel. This idea was the culmination of an impressive collegiate resume and helped land Fred a job at the Texas Company (now know as Texaco) as a research chemist before graduation. But it wasn&rsquo;t long before Fred wanted more.",
